# Fractical
-----------
A hobby project to implement viewing, zooming and exploration of various fractals in OpenGL.

## Dependancies
---------------

#### GLFW
[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) (Graphics Library Framework) is used for window creation and event handling. The GLFW license can be found [here](https://www.glfw.org/license.html).

#### GLEW
[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) is used for interfacing with OpenGL functionality on target systems. The GLEW license can found [here](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew#copyright-and-licensing).

### Compiling
In order to compile the source code, GLFW must be compiled along side the project and GLEW must be linked statically. See the CMakeLists for more details.
